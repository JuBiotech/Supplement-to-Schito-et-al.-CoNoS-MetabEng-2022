# Process modeling

With the Juypter notebooks and related data files in this repository the results of Table 2 can be reproduced.

The notebooks contain detailed descriptions of all modeling steps and fitting results for the two monocultures with engineered strains $\Delta\textsf{ARG}$ $\textsf{LEU}^{++}$ and $\Delta\textsf{LEU}$ $\textsf{ARG}^{+}$ as well as the final co-culture with $\Delta\textsf{ARG}$ $\textsf{LEU}^{++}$ $\leftrightarrow$ $\Delta\textsf{LEU}$ $\textsf{ARG}^{++}$.

## Requirements

The ODE-based formulation, validation and analyses of presented models is based on the pyFOOMB package. Please follow the installation instructions given under https://github.com/MicroPhen/pyFOOMB.
